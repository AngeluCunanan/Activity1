    <p>The Maldives consists of 1,190 islands located in the Indian Ocean, southwest of India. They offer seclusion, breathtaking ocean views, and the most luxurious overwater villas in the World. Amazing scuba diving, snorkeling, and surfing help make the Maldives a unique and fantastic beach destination. The Maldives is irresistible with its white beaches, turquoise sea, blue lagoons, colourful marine life and many palm trees. With a temperature of around 30C all days of the year, the Maldives is a dream come true at any time.

    <p>Maldives, a country of around 550,000 people dispersed across 185 islands, is an upper-middle-income country with a robust growth trajectory. Despite sharp fall in economic activity in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, the economic growth recovered quickly in 2021. Overall, sustained growth performance in the last decade has significantly reduced poverty, and Maldives performs well on poverty outcomes compared to its regional, income, and small island peers.</p>
